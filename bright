## This is just a little hack I wrote to dim the screen brightness  when the function keys responsible for screen dimming don't work.
function bright() {
	echo "Brightness Controller"
	echo "Select brightness level (10-100):"
	select level in "10" "20" "30" "40" "50" "60" "70" "80" "90" "100"; do
		if [[ "$level" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
		# Calculate brightness as a decimal (e.g., 10 -> 0.1)
			brightness=$(echo "scale=1; $level / 100" | bc)
			xrandr --output eDP1 --brightness "$brightness"
			return
		else
			echo "Invalid selection, please choose a brightness level between 10 and 100."
		fi
	done
}
