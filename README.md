nanosecond
==========
This is a collection of my BASH scripts and programming work-in-progress.
To install these scripts, follow the directions below. You will need git installed beforehand, in order to fetch and use all the files.
THIS WILL NOT OVERWRITE YOUR BASH! This only adds my BASH programs to augment your current BASH.

<blockquote><code>sudo apt-get install git-all</code></blockquote>

Open a Terminal and type
<blockquote><code>cd</code></blockquote>
<blockquote><code>mkdir ~/GIT/</code></blockquote>
<blockquote><code>cd ~/GIT</code></blockquote>
<blockquote><code>git clone https://github.com/cypher-neo/nanosecond</code></blockquote>

Then navigate into the created folder like so:
<blockquote><code>cd ~/GIT/nanosecond</code></blockquote>

and type:
<blockquote><code>bash installbash</code></blockquote>

The installer will not overwrite your .bashrc, but will copy a single line to end of your .bashrc to source the modified bashrc file I have included in the nanosecond repo.

After that is complete, close your Terminal and reopen.
You should see a unique Terminal prompt.
Then type:

<blockquote><code>installstuff</code></blockquote>

Follow the menu prompts to install other programs your system can use.
